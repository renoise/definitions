bit = {}

---Normalizes a number to the numeric range for bit operations and returns it.
--This function is usually not needed since all bit operations already normalize
---all of their input arguments. Check the operational semantics for details.
---@param x integer 
---@return integer
function bit.tobit(x) end

---Converts its first argument to a hex string. The number of hex digits is
---given by the absolute value of the optional second argument. Positive numbers
---between 1 and 8 generate lowercase hex digits. Negative numbers generate
---uppercase hex digits. Only the least-significant 4*|n| bits are used. The
---default is to generate 8 lowercase hex digits.
---@param x integer
---@param n integer?
function bit.tohex(x, n) end

---Returns the bitwise **not** of its argument.
---@param x integer
---@return integer
function bit.bnot(x) end

---Returns the bitwise and of all of its arguments. Note that more than two
---arguments are allowed.
---@param x1 integer
---@param ... integer 
---@return integer
function bit.band(x1, ...) end

---Returns the bitwise or of all of its arguments. Note that more than two
---arguments are allowed.
---@param x1 integer
---@param ... integer 
---@return integer
function bit.bor(x1, ...) end

---Returns the bitwise xor of all of its arguments. Note that more than two
---arguments are allowed.
---@param x1 integer
---@param ... integer 
---@return integer
function bit.xor(x1, ...) end

---Returns the bitwise logical left-shift of its first argument by the number of
---bits given by the second argument.
---
---Logical shifts treat the first argument as an unsigned number and shift in
---0-bits. Arithmetic right-shift treats the most-significant bit as a sign bit
---and replicates it. Only the lower 5 bits of the shift count are used (reduces
---to the range [0..31]).
---@param x integer
---@param n integer
---@return integer
function bit.lshift(x, n) end

---Returns the bitwise logical right-shift of its first argument by the number of
---bits given by the second argument.
---
---Logical shifts treat the first argument as an unsigned number and shift in
---0-bits. Arithmetic right-shift treats the most-significant bit as a sign bit
---and replicates it. Only the lower 5 bits of the shift count are used (reduces
---to the range [0..31]).
---@param x integer
---@param n integer
---@return integer
function bit.rshift(x, n) end

---Returns the bitwise arithmetic right-shift of its first argument by the
---number of bits given by the second argument.
---
---Logical shifts treat the first argument as an unsigned number and shift in
---0-bits. Arithmetic right-shift treats the most-significant bit as a sign bit
---and replicates it. Only the lower 5 bits of the shift count are used (reduces
---to the range [0..31]).
---@param x integer
---@param n integer
---@return integer
function bit.arshift(x, n) end

---Returns bitwise left rotation of its first argument by the number of bits
---given by the second argument. Bits shifted out on one side are shifted back
---in on the other side.
---
---Only the lower 5 bits of the rotate count are used (reduces to the range
---[0..31]).
---@param x integer
---@param n integer
---@return integer
function bit.rol(x, n) end

---Returns bitwise right rotation of its first argument by the number of bits
---given by the second argument. Bits shifted out on one side are shifted back
---in on the other side.
---
---Only the lower 5 bits of the rotate count are used (reduces to the range
---[0..31]).
---@param x integer
---@param n integer
---@return integer
function bit.ror(x, n) end

---Swaps the bytes of its argument and returns it. This can be used to convert
---little-endian 32 bit numbers to big-endian 32 bit numbers or vice versa.
---@param x integer
---@return integer
function bit.bswap(x) end
